This is governed by the Boltzmann distribution, where the probability of an electron occupying a state in the conduction band is proportional to exp(-Eg/kT).  When Eg/kT is large,  fewer carriers are available for conduction, leading to higher resistivity. This reduced carrier concentration also influences the screening length (the distance over which electric fields are effectively screened by mobile charges). Fewer carriers imply a longer screening length, exceeding 'one' (likely referring to a characteristic length scale of the system, perhaps related to the material's unit cell or a device feature size). This long screening length enables finer electrical control because external electric fields can penetrate deeper into the material without being immediately screened out.  Furthermore, reduced carrier concentration can lead to enhanced optical confinement, particularly in materials with excitonic effects, as fewer free carriers are available to absorb photons."
