targets:
  forward:
    synthesis:
      material: "monolayer WSe2 (CVD-grown)"
      method: "intense femtosecond-laser irradiation (IFsLI) with oxygen doping"
      atmosphere: "air|O2"         # oxygen from ambient; graphene cover inhibits O participation
      laser:
        pump_wavelength_nm: 400    # frequency-doubled pump used for IFsLI/TA
        fundamental_nm: 800
        pulse_duration_fs: 35
        repetition_rate_hz: 500
      notes: >
        Use fresh spot per shot at high pump (sample on 3D stage) to avoid accumulation.
        Graphene cover suppresses oxygen-related species and O-doping signatures.
