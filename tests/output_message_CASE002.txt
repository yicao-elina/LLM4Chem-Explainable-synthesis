TRANSFER LEARNING PROMPT SENT TO GEMINI:
================================================================================

        You are an expert materials scientist AI. Your task is to reason from analogous data using a structured, interpretable process.
        Your knowledge graph does not contain an exact causal pathway for the user's query.
        However, you have identified the most semantically similar information available.

        **Task:**
        Based on the provided analogous information, predict the resulting material properties for the user's target.
        You must explicitly detail your reasoning process.

        **Target Synthesis Conditions (User's Query):**
        {
  "material": "monolayer WSe2 (CVD-grown)",
  "method": "intense femtosecond-laser irradiation (IFsLI) with oxygen doping",
  "atmosphere": "air|O2",
  "laser": {
    "pump_wavelength_nm": 400,
    "fundamental_nm": 800,
    "pulse_duration_fs": 35,
    "repetition_rate_hz": 500
  },
  "notes": "Use fresh spot per shot at high pump (sample on 3D stage) to avoid accumulation. Graphene cover suppresses oxygen-related species and O-doping signatures.\n",
  "intensity_scale": {
    "initial_exciton_density_cm^-2": {
      "low_range": [
        "9.20e11",
        "3.68e12"
      ],
      "threshold_begin": "6.82e12",
      "mott_density": "1.0e13",
      "high_range": [
        "6.82e12",
        "1.89e13"
      ]
    }
  }
}

        **Most Similar Known Causal Pathway (from Knowledge Graph):**
        - Graphene overlayer on WS2 -> Sharper WS2 bands, shifts
towards Fermi energy,
replica VBM near Q
(Electronic structure)

        **Quantitative Analysis:**
        The embedding distance between the user's desired properties and the most similar known property is 1.0000 (where 0 is identical and 2 is opposite).

        **Your Reasoning Process (Mandatory):**
        1.  **Analyze & Compare:** Briefly compare the User's Query with the Known Pathway. What are the key similarities and, more importantly, the key differences (e.g., opposite doping type, different materials, different conditions)?
        2.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Based on the differences and the quantitative embedding distance, state a hypothesis. For example: "The known pathway describes p-doping via oxidation. The user wants n-doping. The large embedding distance of ~1.0 confirms these concepts are dissimilar. Therefore, a reductive process or a dopant with more valence electrons is required, making the known pathway a poor analogy for direct parameter transfer."
        3.  **Extrapolate or Diverge:** Decide if you can adjust the parameters from the known pathway (extrapolate) or if you must suggest a completely different approach (diverge). Justify this decision using the embedding distance. A small distance (< 0.4) suggests extrapolation is viable; a large distance (> 0.7) suggests divergence is necessary.
        4.  **Synthesize Final Answer:** Based on your hypothesis, construct the final prediction/suggestion.

        **Output Format:**
        Provide your answer in a structured JSON format within a ```json block.
        The JSON MUST include a detailed 'transfer_learning_analysis' object containing your step-by-step reasoning.

        Example JSON output:
        {
          "predicted_properties": {"carrier_type": "p-type", "band_gap_ev": 1.5},
          "reasoning": "The user desires n-type properties, but the most similar context is for p-type doping via oxidation. Acknowledging this contradiction (embedding distance > 1.0), I suggest CVD with a Re precursor, a known n-type doping strategy, rather than adapting the oxidation parameters.",
          "confidence": 0.6293,
          "analogous_path_used": "Graphene overlayer on WS2 -> Sharper WS2 bands, shifts
towards Fermi energy,
replica VBM near Q
(Electronic structure)",
          "property_embedding_distance": 1.0000,
          "transfer_learning_analysis": {
              "1_comparison": "The user's query is for electron-doping (n-type). The known pathway is for hole-doping (p-type) via oxidation. The core electronic goal is opposite.",
              "2_hypothesis": "Because the desired electronic outcome is the inverse of the known pathway, confirmed by a large embedding distance, the synthesis method must also be fundamentally different. Simple parameter adjustments to the oxidation process are inappropriate.",
              "3_decision": "Diverge. The provided context serves as a counterexample. I will ignore its specific parameters and instead access my general knowledge about n-type doping for 2D materials.",
              "4_synthesis": "The final suggestion is based on general knowledge of using Group 7 elements like Rhenium (Re) to n-dope MoS2-like materials, typically via CVD."
          },
          "suggested_next_steps": "Perform DFT calculations to model Re doping. Experimentally, synthesize via CVD and characterize using Hall effect and XPS."
        }
